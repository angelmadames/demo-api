# Demo API

## Overview

This is a base API I created for testing purposes. Not meant for production.

## Environment

Only environment variable needed for the API to work is `PORT`. You could copy the `.env.example` to `.env` or pass it directly as a system environment variable.

## Run it!

To run the API simply execute:

```shell
npm run start
# node app.js
```
